about=Flight Planner allows you to make a plan of photogrammetric flight (block or corridor type) and get 4 layers: projection centres layer, waypoints layer, photo range layer and flight line layer. You can also evaluate the project (or already done flight), by providing 'projection centres' layer with Exterior Orientation parameters in attribute table. In the results you can get: real photos coverage (footprint); number of overlapping images or raster showing GSD.
